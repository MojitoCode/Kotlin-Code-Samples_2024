/*
* Recursion = the process of a function calling itself from within a functionâ€™s code block.
* Required = a base case and a recursive call.
* The base defines which condition must be met in order to exit the recursive function
* The recursive call is used to call the function with a new set of arguments.
* A tail-recursive function is a more efficient way of producing a recursive function because it prevents stack overflow.
